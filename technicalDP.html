                    Electricity is the set of physical phenomena associated with the presence and motion of matter 
                    that has a property of electric charge. In early days, electricity was considered as being unrelated
                    to magnetism. Later on, many experimental results and the development of Maxwell's equations indicated
                    that both electricity and magnetism are from a single phenomenon: electromagnetism. Various common 
                    phenomena are related to electricity, including lightning, static electricity, electric heating, 
                    electric discharges and many others.

                    An electric power system is a network of electrical components deployed to supply, transfer, and
                    use electric power. An example of an electric power system is the grid that provides power to an 
                    extended area. An electrical grid power system can be broadly divided into the generators that 
                    supply the power, the transmission system that carries the power from the generating centres to 
                    the load centres, and the distribution system that feeds the power to nearby homes and industries. 
                    Smaller power systems are also found in industry, hospitals, commercial buildings and homes. The 
                    majority of these systems rely upon three-phase AC power—the standard for large-scale power 
                    transmission and distribution across the modern world. Specialised power systems that do not always 
                    rely upon three-phase AC power are found in aircraft, electric rail systems, ocean liners and 
                    automobiles.

                    In power engineering, the power-flow study, or load-flow study, is a numerical 
                    analysis of the flow of electric power in an interconnected system. A power-flow study 
                    usually uses simplified notations such as a one-line diagram and per-unit system, and 
                    focuses on various aspects of AC power parameters, such as voltages, voltage angles, real 
                    power and reactive power. It analyzes the power systems in normal steady-state operation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A load flow study is especially valuable for a system with multiple load centers, such 
                    as a refinery complex. The power flow study is an analysis of the system’s capability to 
                    adequately supply the connected load. The total system losses, as well as individual line 
                    losses, also are tabulated. Transformer tap positions are selected to ensure the correct 
                    voltage at critical locations such as motor control centers. Performing a load flow study 
                    on an existing system provides insight and recommendations as to the system operation and 
                    optimization of control settings to obtain maximum capacity while minimizing the operating 
                    costs. The results of such an analysis are in terms of active power, reactive power, 
                    magnitude and phase angle. Furthermore, power-flow computations are crucial for optimal 
                    operations of groups of generating units.

                <p>
                    A Short circuit analysis is used to determine the magnitude of short circuit current, 
                    the system is capable of producing, and compares that magnitude with the interrupting 
                    rating of the overcurrent protective devices (OCPD). Since the interrupting ratings 
                    are based by the standards, the methods used in conducting a short circuit analysis 
                    must conform to the procedures which the standard making organizations specify for 
                    this purpose. The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) publishes both the 
                    standards for equipment and the application guides, which describes the calculation 
                    methods. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Short-Circuit Currents are currents that introduce large amounts of destructive energy 
                    in the forms of heat and magnetic force into a power system. A short circuit is 
                    sometimes called a fault. It is a specific kind of current that introduces a large 
                    amount of energy into a power system. It can be in the form of heat or in the form of 
                    magnetic force. Basically, it is a low-resistance path of energy that skips part of a 
                    circuit and causes the bypassed part of the circuit to stop working. The reliability 
                    and safety of electric power distribution systems depend on accurate and thorough 
                    knowledge of short-circuit fault currents that can be present, and on the ability of 
                    protective devices to satisfactorily interrupt these currents. Knowledge of the 
                    computational methods of power system analysis is essential to engineers responsible for 
                    planning, design, operation, and troubleshooting of distribution systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Short-circuit calculations are required for the application and coordination of 
                    protective relays and the rating of equipment. All fault types can be simulated. 
                    Carelab’s short-circuit study provides a detailed report identifying breaker ratings, 
                    breaker fault duties, discussions, and recommendations for any deficiencies found.

                    Electrical equipment malfunctions and failures are responsible for million dollar losses 
                    to facilities, industries and businesses worldwide. As an equipment starts to display signs 
                    of electrical aging, it should act as a trigger for the employer or owner to carry out 
                    preventive maintenance to avoid catastrophic failure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Scheduled routine maintenance can significantly increase the lifespan and reduce their 
                    failure rate for all types of electrical equipment, which can be achieved by having a 
                    proper maintenance program.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A well-administered maintenance plan will reduce accidents, save working personnel's 
                    lives and minimize costly breakdowns and unplanned shutdowns of production equipment.

                    A control system is a system of devices or set of devices, that manages, commands, directs 
                    or regulates the behavior of other devices or systems to achieve desired results. In other 
                    words, the definition of a control system can be simplified as a system, which controls 
                    other systems. As the human civilization is being modernized day by day the demand for 
                    automation is increasing accordingly. Automation highly requires control of devices.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In recent years, control systems have played a central role in the development and 
                    advancement of modern technology and civilization. Practically every aspect of our 
                    day-to-day life is affected less or more by some control system. A bathroom toilet 
                    tank, a refrigerator, an air conditioner, a geezer, an automatic iron, an automobile 
                    all are control system. These systems are also used in industrial processes for more 
                    output. We find control systems in the quality control of products, weapons system, 
                    transportation systems, power system, space technology, robotics and many more.

                <p>
                    Telecommunication, science and practice of transmitting information by electromagnetic means. Modern 
                    telecommunication centres on the problems involved in transmitting large volumes of information over 
                    long distances without damaging loss due to noise and interference. The basic components of a modern 
                    digital telecommunications system must be capable of transmitting voice, data, radio, and television 
                    signals. Digital transmission is employed in order to achieve high reliability and because the cost of 
                    digital switching systems is much lower than the cost of analog systems. In order to use digital 
                    transmission, however, the analog signals that make up most voice, radio, and television communication 
                    must be subjected to a process of analog-to-digital conversion. (In data transmission this step is 
                    bypassed because the signals are already in digital form; most television, radio, and voice 
                    communication, however, use the analog system and must be digitized.) In many cases, the digitized 
                    signal is passed through a source encoder, which employs a number of formulas to reduce redundant 
                    binary information. After source encoding, the digitized signal is processed in a channel encoder, 
                    which introduces redundant information that allows errors to be detected and corrected. The encoded 
                    signal is made suitable for transmission by modulation onto a carrier wave and may be made part of a 
                    larger signal in a process known as multiplexing. The multiplexed signal is then sent into a 
                    multiple-access transmission channel. After transmission, the above process is reversed at the 
                    receiving end, and the information is extracted.
