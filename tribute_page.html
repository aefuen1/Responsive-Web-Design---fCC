                    Nikola Tesla is a giant of electricity. He became one of the most importants
                    engineers of the history, and that's because all his contributions, inventions and theories 
                    were essential to make the electricity (and something more) the way it is nowadays. In this
                    brief tribute, we will board some of the most important facts of his life. <br><br>

                    The most remembered story of Nikola Tesla is that he went into a hard legally battle 
                    against Thomas Alva Edison to establish the way that electricity should be served to people. 
                    This is known as the DC vs. AC war. Even though Tesla lost this battle on that moment, the 
                    time gave him the reason. AC power is the most used today because it has many advantages 
                    over DC power. <br><br>

                    Apart from this, he is probably the biggest inspiration for scientist nowadays, because 
                    he always worked to create many alternatives (registering over 300 patents), and give the 
                    humanity all the solutions that he thought were necessary. By the moment of his death, he 
                    was going on a situation of extreme poverty because all the money he made was invested into 
                    new projects and new inventions. A true hero! <br><br>
